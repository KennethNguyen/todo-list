## Description

A todo-list created using React

My first exposure using React and learning about JSX, props, mapping components, react state, setState, importing/exporting components, parent/child components, forms, class vs functional compoents, and the importance of 'this'

Inspired by [Bob Ziroll's React Todo App Tutorial](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact)

Added features from the original tutorial includes:
* Form to add a new todo task to make application dynamic
* Delete option for each task to remove from list

## Utilized
* Framework: React
* HTML | Javascript | CSS

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/KennethNguyen/todo-list`
* `cd todo-list && npm install`
* `npm start`
